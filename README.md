# GLabs — Where Prompts Become Agents 🤖

GLabs is an AI-powered prompt-to-agent platform that transforms natural-language prompts into structured, production-ready AI agents and automated workflows. It is designed to help developers, automation engineers, and AI practitioners bridge the gap between prompt engineering and real-world automation.

Rather than treating prompts as static text, GLabs evaluates, optimizes, and operationalizes them—turning user intent into executable agent logic compatible with workflow automation tools such as n8n.
